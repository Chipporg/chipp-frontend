        <h2>Access and use of the services</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Services Description:</b> The Services are offered as a platform
          (the "Platform") to users of the Services, which may include Campaign
          Organizers (interchangeably used with "Organizers"), Beneficiaries,
          Recipients and Donors (each defined herein) and other users of the
          Services (which may include users who interact with the Site or
          Services). Among other features, the Services are designed to allow a
          user (a "Campaign Organizer") to post a fundraising campaign
          ("Campaign") to the Platform to accept monetary donations
          ("Donations") from those users wishing to contribute funds to the
          Campaign ("Donors"). A Campaign Organizer may be both, a Beneficiary
          and a Recipient, for any Campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          A “Beneficiary” includes an individual, a group of individuals, or any
          entity that benefits from Donations through a Campaign, and a
          Recipient. A “Recipient” includes an individual or entity that is
          authorised by the Beneficiary through written means to receive
          Donations on behalf of the Beneficiary. Although there are no fees to
          set up a Campaign, a percentage of each Donation will be charged as
          fees for our Services and those of our third-party payment processors.
          Please see our Pricing section for details.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Services are a Platform; We are not a Broker, Financial
          Institution, Creditor or Charitable Institution: The Services are an
          administrative platform only. Chipp facilitates the Donation
          transaction between Organizers and Donors, but is not a party to any
          agreement between an Organizer and a Donor, or between any user and a
          Charity. Chipp is not a broker, agent, financial institution, creditor
          or insurer for any user. Chipp has no control over the conduct of, or
          any information provided by an Organizer or a Charity, and Chipp
          hereby disclaims all liability in this regard. Anyone is free to
          report issues related to a Campaign on Chipp, and Chipp will take
          necessary action to the best of its abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chipp does not guarantee that a Campaign or a Charity will obtain a
          certain amount of Donations or any Donations at all. We do not
          personally endorse any Campaign, Organizer, or Charity, and we make no
          guarantee, explicit or implied, that any information provided through
          the Services by a user is accurate. We expressly disclaim any
          liability or responsibility for the success of any Campaign, or the
          outcome of any fundraising purpose. You, as a Donor, must make the
          final determination as to the value and appropriateness of
          contributing to any Campaign, Organizer, or Charity. You can write to
          us for any clarification, and we shall make our best effort to share
          the information that we have.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we try our best to do so, we cannot and do not verify 100% of
          the information that Organizer supply. We try our best to see that
          Donations are used in accordance with the stated fundraising purpose;
          we collect documents for verification related to Campaigns before
          publishing the Campaign page on chipp.co.in, or in other cases that
          Chipp may determine, at its sole discretion. However, please
          understand that we cannot guarantee that 100% of the time Donations
          will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose prescribed by
          an Organizer or Charity. We assume no responsibility to verify whether
          the Donations are used in accordance with any applicable laws, and
          such responsibility rests solely with the Organizer or Charity, as
          applicable. While we have no legal obligation to verify that the use
          of any funds raised is in accordance with applicable law and these
          Terms of Service, we try to do the verifications for many campaigns
          and more important we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse
          of funds raised very seriously. If you have reason to believe that an
          Organizer or Charity is not raising or using the funds for their
          stated purpose, please use the "Report" button on the Campaign to
          alert our team of this potential issue and we will investigate to the
          best of our abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          You, as an Organizer, represent, warrant, and covenant that (i) all
          information you provide in connection with a Campaign is accurate,

          any user; and (ii) all Donations contributed to your Campaign will be
          used solely as described in the materials that you post; and (iii) you
          will comply with all relevant local, state, and Union laws applicable
          to you when you solicit funds, particularly but not limited to laws
          relating to your marketing and solicitation for your project. We
          reserve the right to provide information relating to your Campaign
          with donors and beneficiaries of your Campaign, and with law
          enforcement or to assist in any investigation.

          information, including information related to credit cards other
          payment instrument, you provide to Chipp is true. You are authorized
          to use the payment instrument. You agree that a certain minimum
          Donation amount may apply, and subject to the refund policy, that all
          Donation payments are final and cannot be refunded. Donors may have
          the option to contribute recurring period Donations, and in electing
          to contribute on a recurring basis, you, as a Donor, (i) agree to
          promptly update your account information with any changes (for
          example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration
          date) that may occur and to pay the Donation amount that you specify.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chipp shall transfer payments, net of its costs, charges and fees into
          the bank account details designated by the Campaign organizer during
          the fund withdrawal process. Once Chipp has made transfers into the
          designated bank account, Chipp shall be discharged of any/all
          liability towards the Campaign organizer, Organizer, Beneficiary,
          Recipient and contributors/donors and the Campaigner, Organizer,
          Beneficiary, Recipient, donors, and contributors shall not be eligible
          for any claims and/or refunds thereof.
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">

            The Purpose, has been clearly declared on the fund-raising page, and
            you have clearly understood the project and the utilization of
            funds.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your donations will be transferred to the Recipient, and will be
            utilized for the benefit of the Beneficiary.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chipp and the payment gateway will deduct their fees and applicable
            taxes before providing the funds to the Recipient. The Company will
            deduct the fees on behalf of the platform which has hosted the
            project profile in the internet, and has facilitated the
            contributions to the project. You understand that the fees are
            towards web hosting, marketing, and promotion, and that Chipp is
            only facilitating in collection of the fees on behalf of the owners
            of the Platform.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <b>Fees:</b> Chipp does not charge an Organizer any upfront fees for
          initiating a Campaign. Chipp retains a flat percentage of each
          Donation contributed to a Campaign and all charitable contributions
          made to a Charity (collectively, "Chipp Platform Fees"). An additional
          payment processing fee is also deducted from each Donation and is
          payable directly to our third-party payment processors (the "Payment
          Processing Fee," and together with the Chipp Fees, the "Fees"). In
          some cases, where the Campaign Organizer has requested, through a
          written consent, for additional outreach from Chipp through social
          media to raise funds, Chipp shall retain an additional percentage of
          each Donation contributed to a Campaign from the start of outreach
          effort towards the costs incurred for such efforts (collectively,
          “Additional Outreach costs”) Donors acknowledge that by contributing a
          Donation to a Campaign, the Donor is agreeing to any and all
          applicable terms and conditions set forth by a third party payment
          processor, in addition to these Terms of Service.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fees are deducted directly from each Donation, and will not be
          reflected in the amount which an Organizer can withdraw from the
          Campaign or which is directed to a Charity. We reserve the right to
          change Chipp's pricing from time to time. If Chipp does change its
          Fees, Chipp will provide notice of the change on the Site or in email
          to you, at Chipp's option, at least 30 days before the change is to
          take effect. Your continued use of the Services after the Fee change
          becomes effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Fees.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Account Holds:</b> From time to time, Chipp may place a hold on a
          Campaign account (a "Hold") restricting Withdrawals (defined herein)
          by an Organizer. Some of the reasons that we may place a Hold on a
          Campaign Account include the following: (i) if we have reason to
          believe (in our sole discretion) that information provided by an
          Organizer is false, misleading, or fraudulent, or that funds are being
          used in a prohibited manner, (ii) if the funds available should be
          provided directly to a person other than the Beneficiary (such as a
          legal beneficiary or person entitled by law to act on behalf of a
          Beneficiary), (iii) if we have reason to believe that a Campaign or
          Organizer has violated these Terms of Service, (iv) if we think we
          need additional documentation to have reasonable assurance on
          utilization of Donations for the purpose stated in the Campaign, or
          (iv) if required in order to comply with a court order, subpoena,
          writ, injunction, or as otherwise required under applicable laws and
          regulations. If you have questions about a Hold we may have placed on
          your Campaign account, or need information about how to resolve the
          Hold, please contact us at contactus@chipp.co.in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Withdrawing Donations from a Campaign: Subject to approvals from
          Chipp, you, as an Organizer (or, as applicable, the beneficiary
          designated by the Campaign), may withdraw Donations to your Campaign
          at any time up to the full amount of all Donations credited to your
          Campaign, less Fees and any previously withdrawn amounts
          ("Withdrawals") and subject to any Holds that we may place on your
          Campaign account. An Organizer may withdraw Donations by electronic
          wire transfer to the designated bank account. While Chipp strives to
          make Withdrawals available to you promptly, you acknowledge and agree
          Withdrawals may not be available to you for use immediately, and Chipp
          does not guarantee that Withdrawals will be available to you within
          any specific time frame, and Chipp expressly disclaims any and all
          responsibility for any delay or inability to access and use
          Withdrawals at any specified time, and any consequences arising from
          such delay or inability. You, as an Organizer, are responsible for
          ensuring that the information you provide to the Campaign in order to
          process a Withdrawal, including the bank account information,
          statutory information including but not limited to valid government
          issued IDs of the Beneficiary and the Recipient for the purpose of
          KYC, is accurate and up to date.

            <p>
              The verification will be essential to withdraw funds from Chipp,
              and may be asked by Chipp, at its sole discretion, during the
              course of a campaign. Failure to comply, may result in
              cancellation of a fundraising campaign, and funds may be returned

              Campaign Organizers may not create multiple Campaigns without
              proof of meeting fulfilment obligations from the original
              Campaign. Failure to adequately fulfil Campaign obligations may
              result in Chipp removing the Campaign(s) and seeking reimbursement
              of Campaign funds raised, including by using third-party
              collection services. Only the Campaign Owner shall be permitted to
              collect Campaign funds.

              connection with Campaign Owners and/or Recipients.
            </p>

              Campaign Owners may not use a false email address to self-fund, or
              contribute to, their own Campaigns; this is a violation of Stripe
              policies and of our Terms of Use.

            <p>
              Chipp may attempt to verify the identity and other information
              provided to us by Campaign Owners, and we may delay, withhold,
              reverse or refund any Contributions or other amounts without
              notice or liability in the event we are unable to verify any such
              information to our satisfaction. Campaign Owner eligibility is
              subject to Chipp’s review of the fulfilment status of prior
              crowdfunding obligations.

              (PAN) of Campaign Owners and any beneficiaries and/or Recipients
              so that we may report taxable income to the relevant taxing

          sublicensable, perpetual, irrevocable license to copy, display,

          distortion, alteration, optical illusion, or other use or exploitation
          of your name, image or likeness, and (iii) any liability for claims
          made by you (or any successor to any claim you might bring) in
          connection with your User Content, name, image or likeness. You waive
          any right to inspect or approve any intermediary version(s) or
          finished version(s) of the results of the use of your User Content

          (other than you) appears in your User Content, you represent and
          warrant that you have secured all necessary licenses, waivers and
          releases from such person(s) for the benefit of Chipp in a manner

          and submission of User Content is voluntary and that you will not
          receive financial compensation of any type associated with the
          licenses, waivers, and releases set forth herein (or Chipp's
          exploitation thereof), and that the sole consideration for subject
          matter of this agreement is the opportunity to use the Services.

          <b>Copyright Complaints:</b> Chipp respects the intellectual property
          of others, and we ask our users to do the same. If you believe that
          your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright
          infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been
          otherwise violated, you should notify Chipp of your infringement claim
          in accordance with the procedure set forth below.

          property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement. A
          notification of claimed copyright infringement should be emailed to
          Chipp's Copyright Agent at contactus@chipp.co.in (Subject line:

        </ul>
        <p>
          If a counter-notice is received, Chipp will send a copy of the
          counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person
          that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10
          business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a
          court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed
          content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14

          appropriate circumstances and at Chipp's sole discretion, users who
          are deemed to be repeat infringers. Chipp may also at its sole
          discretion limit access to the Services and/or terminate the
          memberships of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights
          of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.

            <b>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration:</b> PLEASE READ THIS
            SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS
          </u>
        </p>
        <p>
          Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user's
          satisfaction by emailing Chipp support at contactus@chipp.co.in In the
          unlikely event that our user support team is unable to resolve a
          complaint you may have (or if Chipp has not been able to resolve a
          dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each
          agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration,
          mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general
          jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less
          formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
          judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that
          a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take
          place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are
          not permitted.
        </p>
        <h2>Arbitration agreement</h2>
        <p>
          Chipp and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us.
          This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It
          includes, but is not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>
            claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship
            between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud,
            misrepresentation or any other legal theory.
          </li>
          <li>
            claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but
            not limited to, claims relating to advertising).
          </li>
          <li>
            claims that are currently the subject of purported class action
            litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class
          </li>
          <li>
            claims that may arise after the termination of this Terms of Service
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          References to "Chipp", "we", "you", and "us" include our respective
          subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest,
          successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized
          users or beneficiaries of services or devices under this or prior
          agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may
          bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration
          agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention
          of federal, state or local agencies. Such agencies can, if the law
          allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by
          entering into this Terms of Service, you and Chipp are each waiving
          the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. This
          arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Terms of
          Service.
        </p>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>
          You agree that Chipp, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate
          your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Services and remove
          and discard any content within the Services, for any reason,
          including, without limitation, for lack of use or if Chipp believes
          that you have violated or acted inconsistently with the letter or
          spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or
          illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of
          Services, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities.
          Chipp may also in its sole discretion and at any time discontinue
          providing the Services, or any part thereof, with or without notice.
          You agree that any termination of your access to the Services under
          any provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior
          notice, and acknowledge and agree that Chipp may immediately
          deactivate or delete your account and all related information and
          files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or
          the Services. Further, you agree that Chipp will not be liable to you
          or any third party for any termination of your access to the Services.
        </p>
        <h2>User disputes</h2>
        <p>
          You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with
          any other user in connection with the Services and Chipp will have no
          liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Chipp reserves the
          right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with
          disputes between you and any other user of the Services.
        </p>
        <h2>General</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and
          Chipp and govern your use of the Services, superseding any prior
          agreements between you and Chipp with respect to the Services. You
          also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply
          when you use affiliate or third-party services, third party content or
          third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the
          laws of India without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With
          respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set
          forth above, you and Chipp agree to submit to the personal and
          exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within
          Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The failure of Chipp to exercise or enforce
          any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of
          Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
          the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give
          effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and
          the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force
          and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
          contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
          use of the Services or these Terms of Service must be filed within one
          (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
          barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
          electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
          proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same
          extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents
          and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You
          may not assign these Terms of Service without the prior written
          consent of Chipp, but Chipp may assign or transfer these Terms of
          Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles
          in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal
          or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or
          regular mail. The Services may also provide notices to you of changes
          to these Terms of Service or other matters by displaying notices or
          links to notices generally on the Services.
