        <h2>About Chipp</h2>
        <p>
          We are Chipp, a professional fundraising organisation working for
          charities, nonprofit organisations, schools, groups and political
          campaigns to help each organisation raise the money it needs to serve
          the good cause.

        <p>
          Our aim is to raise funds through crowdfunding, running out campaigns
          and facilitating events. As a fundraiser, we work out plans to raise
          funds for the cause by guiding the organisations and put out our best
          in terms of marketing efforts to promote the cause.{" "}
        </p>

          Chipp’s mission and vision besides raising funds is to create
          awareness about prevalent issues amidst the society by educating
          people, building partnerships and supporting community relationships.
