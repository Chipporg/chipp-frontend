              any one or more such provisions shall be determined to be invalid,
              illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part, and the validity,
              legality and enforceability of any of the remaining provisions or
              portions thereof shall not in any way be affected thereby and
              shall nevertheless be binding between the parties hereto. Any such
              invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof
              shall be changed and interpreted so as to best accomplish the
              objectives of such provision or portion thereof within the limits

              that he/ she/ it is prohibited from assigning the rights and
              obligations under this Agreement. However, Chipp may assign its

              claim between the parties arises out of or in connection with this
              Agreement, including the breach, termination or invalidity thereof
              (a Dispute), the parties shall use all reasonable endeavours to
              negotiate with a view to resolving the Dispute amicably. If a
              party gives the other party notice that a Dispute has arisen (a
              Dispute Notice) and the parties are unable to resolve the Dispute
              amicably within 30 (thirty) days of service of the Dispute Notice
              (or such longer period as the parties may mutually agree), then
              the Dispute shall be referred to arbitration by a sole arbitrator
              appointed by Chipp accordance with the Arbitration and
              Conciliation Act, 1996 (as amended, restated or substituted, in
              force at the relevant time) to be conducted at Lucknow.
              <br />
              The arbitral award shall be reasoned and shall be final and
              binding on the disputing parties. The existence or subsistence of
              a dispute between the parties, or the commencement or continuation
              of arbitration proceedings, shall not, in any manner, prevent or
              postpone the performance of those obligations of the parties under
              the Agreement which are not in dispute, and the arbitrators shall
              give due consideration to such performance, if any, in making a
              final award. Nothing shall preclude a party from seeking interim
              or permanent equitable or injunctive relief, or both. The pursuit
              of equitable or injunctive relief shall not be a waiver of the
              right of the parties to pursue any other remedy or relief through
              the arbitration.
